# Mac

## Setup

1. Navigate to the `./mac/` directory.
2. Execute `./setup.sh`

## Philosophy

This Mac configuration aims to be simple and powerful. It often relies often
sensible defaults.

In some cases, it prefers "good enough" to "perfect" if it means keeping the
system dependencies fewer.

## Applications

### Browser

Safari is the Browser of choice. Extensions are installed automatically using
the Brewfile and MAS.

### IDEs and Text Editors

The IDEs of choice are IntelliJ IDEA and Rider. The text editor of choice is
Neovim inside of the Apple Terminal.

### Password Manager

1Password is a solid and boring choice here, and it is cross platform, which is convenient.
